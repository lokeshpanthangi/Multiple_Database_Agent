1. Select a connected database from the sidebar.
2. Type your natural language query or SQL command into the message input field.
3. Press Enter to send your query. Use Shift+Enter for a new line.
4. The AI agent will process your query and return the results in a structured table or a chart (if applicable).
5. You can view the generated SQL query, copy it, or export the results to CSV/JSON.

### Managing Query History
1. Access the "Query History" section in the sidebar or settings.
2. View a list of all your past queries.
3. Use the search and filter options to find specific queries.
4. Mark frequently used queries as favorites for quick access.
5. Re-execute any saved query directly from the history.

### Customizing Settings
1. Navigate to the "Settings" section.
2. Adjust appearance (light/dark theme), query preferences (timeout, result limits), performance settings, and privacy options.
3. Your changes will be saved automatically.

## 5. Project Structure

## 6. Accessibility

The application is built with a strong focus on accessibility, adhering to WCAG guidelines. Key accessibility features include:

- **Semantic HTML**: Proper use of HTML5 elements for structure and meaning.
- **ARIA Attributes**: Extensive use of `aria-label`, `aria-describedby`, `aria-live`, and other ARIA attributes to enhance screen reader compatibility.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard navigability for all interactive elements, including custom focus management and skip links.
- **Focus Management**: Implementation of focus traps for modal dialogs to ensure a logical tab order.
- **High Contrast Mode**: Support for users who prefer high contrast themes, with styles adapting automatically.
- **Reduced Motion**: Respects user preferences for reduced motion, disabling or simplifying animations.
- **Live Regions**: Dynamic content changes are announced to screen reader users via `aria-live` regions.

## 7. Performance Optimizations

Performance is a critical aspect of the application, and several techniques have been employed to ensure a fast and responsive user experience:

- **Lazy Loading**: Components and images are loaded on demand, reducing initial bundle size and load times.
- **Debouncing and Throttling**: Input and scroll events are debounced/throttled to prevent excessive re-renders and API calls.
- **Virtual Scrolling**: For large lists and tables, only visible items are rendered, significantly improving performance.
- **Memoization**: React's `memo` and `useMemo`/`useCallback` hooks are used to prevent unnecessary re-renders of components and expensive computations.
- **Optimized State Updates**: State updates are batched and optimized to minimize rendering cycles.
- **Resource Preloading**: Critical resources like fonts and images can be preloaded for a smoother experience.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Integrated hooks for monitoring memory usage and performance budgets.

## 8. Error Handling

Robust error handling is implemented throughout the application to provide a resilient and user-friendly experience:

- **React Error Boundaries**: Component-level and page-level error boundaries catch UI rendering errors gracefully.
- **User-Friendly Fallbacks**: Custom fallback UIs provide clear messages and actionable options (retry, go home, copy error details).
- **Asynchronous Error Handling**: Dedicated mechanisms for catching and managing errors in asynchronous operations (e.g., API calls).
- **Detailed Error Logging**: In development, errors are logged with full stack traces and component information for easy debugging.
- **Context-Specific Errors**: Different error messages and recovery options are provided based on the context of the error (e.g., database connection errors, chat errors).
